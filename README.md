# Microcontroller
The objective of this project was to design, synthesize, and simulate a simple
microcontroller in Verilog. Using combinational and sequential circuits and combining them sharing a bus.

In the files you can find 2 versions, the synthesize one and the verilog code.
Simulation waveform screenshots, every transaction on bus with clear explanation; zoom in to show delay if
synthesized.
